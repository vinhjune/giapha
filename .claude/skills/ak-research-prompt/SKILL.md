# Research Prompt

Write one self-contained paragraph that gives a researcher enough context to
produce decision-ready, source-backed findings without a follow-up exchange.
This skill writes the brief; it does not perform the research.

## Workflow

1. Gather the decision, audience, deadline, known facts, constraints, and
   intended use from the conversation and relevant project files.
2. State the project and situation for a reader with no prior context.
3. Define one research question and the decision it will inform.
4. Add three to six inline numbered sub-questions that fully cover the
   decision. Do not combine unrelated missions.
5. Specify include and avoid constraints, source hierarchy, contradiction
   handling, a completion bar, and the per-finding output format.
6. Return exactly one paragraph. Do not add headings, a preface, or a second
   deliverable.

## Required Brief Content

The paragraph must:

- lead with plain-English project context, the research goal, and the decision;
- prefer primary sources such as official documentation, repositories, papers,
  filings, and changelogs;
- treat forums and social posts as weak signals, never as factual proof;
- separate confirmed facts, inference, and unresolved uncertainty when sources
  conflict;
- require a gap round that revisits contradictions and single-source claims;
- require a source URL, specific claim, and one-line decision relevance for
  every finding; and
- require a single detailed Markdown result.

## Boundaries

- Do not manufacture facts or include secrets, private URLs, credentials, or
  personal data in a brief.
- Use ak-research, available in the engineer kit, or another research runner to
  execute the completed brief.
- Keep the final paragraph focused on evidence and a decision, not marketing
  copy or a speculative solution.
