# Vibe Pipeline

Run a full autonomous product-development pipeline from request intake to PR
readiness, with optional merge and post-merge CI convergence.

This skill orchestrates across `/ak:worktree`, `/ak:plan`, `/ak:cook`, `/ak:fix`,
`/ak:code-review`, `/ak:ship`, and `/ak:review-pr`. It does NOT bypass those
skills' approval gates, tests, code-review blockers, branch protections, or
security policies.

## Inputs

Accepted forms:

```bash
/ak:vibe <github-issue-url>
/ak:vibe --ship --beta <github-issue-url>
/ak:vibe --both <github-issue-url>
/ak:vibe --ship <feature request>
```

Flags:

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--beta` | Ship to beta/dev target via `/ak:ship beta`; final ready label is `ready to ship beta`. |
| `--ship` | After review/fix/reply, merge the PR and watch/fix CI until success or true external blocker. |
| `--both` | Dual-stage ship: run the full beta stage first (ship, review, merge, watch CI until green), then the stable stage (ship official, review, merge, watch CI until green). Implies `--ship` for both stages; supersedes `--beta`. |
| no `--beta` | Ship stable via `/ak:ship official`; final ready label is `ready to ship stable`. |
| no `--ship` | Stop after PR is reviewed, fixed, replied, and labeled ready. |

Rows describe individual flags in isolation; when `--both` is present, mode
resolution below wins. Mode resolution: `--both` > `--beta` > default stable.
If `--both` and `--beta` are given together, warn once and proceed in `both`
mode.

## Pipeline

1. **Parse and analyze request**
   - Strip `--ship`, `--beta`, and `--both` from arguments, then resolve ship mode (`both` > `beta` > stable). `--both` implies `--ship`.
   - If remaining input is a GitHub issue URL/number, treat that issue as the source of truth. Do not create a duplicate.
   - If remaining input is natural language, treat it as the feature request and create the GitHub issue after plan validation/red-team.
   - Resolve repo with `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,defaultBranchRef`.
   - For GitHub issue URLs, parse `OWNER/REPO` from the URL and compare it with the current repo. If it differs, stop and ask the user to switch to the matching repo/worktree or provide an issue from the current repo.
   - For issue inputs, read the title, body, and comments with `gh issue view`. For natural-language inputs, use the text directly.
   - Extract concrete outcome, acceptance criteria, scope boundary, non-negotiable constraints, blockers, and likely touched surfaces.
   - Classify implementation route:
     - **Bugfix route** when the issue/request is a bug, regression, broken behavior, failing test/CI, production/staging incident, error log, or explicitly says fix/debug/repair.
     - **Feature route** for net-new capability, enhancement, refactor, or ambiguous product work.
   - Detect an existing plan if the user provides a plan path, the issue body/comments link a `plans/.../plan.md`, or a current worktree already contains a matching plan. Verify the file exists before treating it as reusable.
   - If any of those are ambiguous enough to change implementation, ask before worktree creation. Otherwise proceed and carry the extracted requirements into planning and issue updates.

2. **Create isolated worktree and branch**
   - Activate `/ak:worktree` to create an isolated worktree and branch.
   - Use a descriptive branch name derived from the issue/request.
   - If an existing clean feature worktree/branch already matches the request, reuse it and record why.
   - Never work directly on `main`, `master`, `dev`, `beta`, or `develop`.

3. **Plan intake and gates**
   - If a valid existing `plan.md` was detected, set `plan.md` to its absolute path, reuse it, and skip `/ak:plan --tdd`.
   - If no valid plan exists, in the new worktree activate:
     ```bash
     /ak:plan --tdd "<source issue or feature request>"
     ```
   - For newly created plans, capture the absolute `plan.md` path from `/ak:plan --tdd`.
   - Always run both gates, even when the plan already existed:
     ```bash
     /ak:plan validate <plan.md>
     /ak:plan red-team <plan.md>
     ```
   - Before implementation, perform the whole-plan consistency sweep required by `/ak:plan`.
   - Do not proceed to implementation while validation failures, accepted red-team findings, or unresolved contradictions remain.

4. **Create or update GitHub issue**
   - Ensure labels exist:
     ```bash
     gh label list --json name --jq '.[].name' | grep -Fx "ready to cook" >/dev/null \
       || gh label create "ready to cook" --color "0E8A16" --description "Plan validated; ready for ak:cook or ak:fix"
     gh label list --json name --jq '.[].name' | grep -Fx "in progress" >/dev/null \
       || gh label create "in progress" --color "FBCA04" --description "Implementation is in progress"
     gh label list --json name --jq '.[].name' | grep -Fx "ready to ship stable" >/dev/null \
       || gh label create "ready to ship stable" --color "5319E7" --description "PR reviewed and ready for stable merge"
     gh label list --json name --jq '.[].name' | grep -Fx "ready to ship beta" >/dev/null \
       || gh label create "ready to ship beta" --color "1D76DB" --description "PR reviewed and ready for beta merge"
     ```
   - If label creation fails for anything other than an existing label, stop and report the exact `gh` error.
   - Compute relative plan link from repo root.
   - If source issue exists, update/comment on it. If input was natural language, create a new issue.
   - Issue update must include:
     - branch name
     - implementation route (`feature` via `/ak:cook` or `bugfix` via `/ak:fix`)
     - implementation summary
     - relative plan link
     - ship mode (`official`, `beta`, or `both`)
     - acceptance criteria from the plan
   - Add `ready to cook`; remove stale `ready to ship stable` and `ready to ship beta`.

5. **Implement or fix**
   - Before activating `/ak:cook` or `/ak:fix`, update the pipeline GitHub issue:
     ```bash
     gh issue edit <issue-number-or-url> --add-label "in progress" --remove-label "ready to cook"
     ```
   - If `ready to cook` is not currently on the issue, use `--add-label "in progress"` without `--remove-label`.
   - If the label update fails for any other reason, stop and report the exact `gh` error. Do not start implementation while the issue state still says `ready to cook`.
   - If the request is on the bugfix route, activate:
     ```bash
     /ak:fix --auto <plan.md>
     ```
   - Pass the source issue/request, failure evidence, validated plan path, scope boundary, and acceptance criteria into `/ak:fix`.
   - If the request is on the feature route, activate:
     ```bash
     /ak:cook --tdd --auto <plan.md>
     ```
   - Honor every hard gate in `/ak:cook`.
   - Honor every hard gate in `/ak:fix` on the bugfix route.
   - If implementation stops for user/business decision, update the GitHub issue with blocker details and stop.

6. **Review local implementation**
   - Activate:
     ```bash
     /ak:code-review --pending
     ```
   - Fix Critical and Important findings before shipping.
   - Re-run relevant validation after fixes.

7. **Ship PR**
   - If `--both` is present, start with the beta stage:
     ```bash
     /ak:ship beta
     ```
     The stable stage runs later, in step 10, only after beta merge and beta CI success.
   - Else if `--beta` is present:
     ```bash
     /ak:ship beta
     ```
   - Otherwise:
     ```bash
     /ak:ship official
     ```
   - Capture PR URL/number from `/ak:ship` output.

8. **Review/fix/reply PR**
   - Activate:
     ```bash
     /ak:review-pr <pr-url-or-number> --fix --reply
     ```
   - Do not continue until actionable findings are resolved or an external blocker is documented.
   - PR checks must be terminal and green unless the blocker is external and recorded.

9. **Apply ready label**
   - If beta mode: add `ready to ship beta`.
   - If both mode: add `ready to ship beta` now; `ready to ship stable` is added in step 10 when the stable-stage PR passes review.
   - Otherwise: add `ready to ship stable`.
   - Add the label to both the source issue and PR when possible.
   - Remove `ready to cook` and `in progress` after PR review/fix succeeds.

10. **Optional merge and CI convergence**
    - Only run this step when `--ship` or `--both` is present.
    - Merge via GitHub using repository convention and branch protection. Prefer `gh pr merge --auto` when required checks are still pending; otherwise use the repo's allowed merge method.
    - Never force push. Never direct-push to protected target branches.
    - After merge, watch target-branch CI/deploy workflows for the merge commit.
    - If CI fails with a deterministic repo-fixable error:
      1. Inspect the failed run/job logs with `gh run view`.
      2. Create a follow-up fix branch/worktree from the target branch.
      3. Activate `/ak:fix --auto` with exact failing command/error evidence.
      4. Ship the follow-up in the same mode (during `--both`, the current stage's mode: beta stage → beta, stable stage → official), run `/ak:review-pr --fix --reply`, merge, and watch again.
    - Stop only when target-branch CI succeeds, an external blocker remains, or the same blocker survives 3 fix attempts.
    - **Dual-stage (`--both`) sequence:**
      1. **Beta stage:** merge the beta PR and watch beta/dev-branch CI to green using the merge and fix loop above.
      2. Do not start the stable stage while beta CI is red, pending, or blocked. If the beta stage ends on an external blocker or exhausts fix attempts, stop, report, and mark the stable stage as skipped.
      3. **Stable stage:** after beta CI is green, ship stable. Pick the path from how the beta merge landed:
         - If the feature is already merged into the beta/dev branch and the repository promotes beta/dev into stable by convention (release/promotion PR from dev to main), follow that convention. Before merging a promotion PR, list the commits it carries; if it sweeps unrelated work beyond this issue, stop and ask the user instead of merging silently.
         - If the feature branch is still independent of the stable target (no promotion convention; stable receives feature PRs directly), activate `/ak:ship official` from the feature branch.
      4. Capture the stable PR, then activate `/ak:review-pr <stable-pr> --fix --reply`, apply `ready to ship stable` to the source issue and stable PR, and remove `ready to ship beta`.
      5. Merge the stable PR and watch stable-branch CI to green with the same merge and fix loop. The run is complete only when stable CI succeeds or a documented external blocker remains.

## Security

- Never write secrets, tokens, customer data, or private env values into issues, PRs, comments, plans, or logs.
- Redact sensitive command output before posting to GitHub.
- If `gh` auth lacks permission to create labels, issues, PRs, reviews, or merges, stop and report the exact missing capability.
- If CI fails because of missing secrets, unavailable services, or required human approval, record it as an external blocker. Do not weaken tests or hide failures.
