# Test Failure Fix Workflow

For fixing failing tests and test-suite regressions.

## Progress Tracking

The stages are `collect failures → diagnose → plan → implement → retest →
review`. Discover the live task-management surface and mirror this dependency
chain when available. Otherwise, update the active plan. Plan files are the
durable source of truth.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Compile and Collect Failures

Use the tester agent. Fix syntax or compilation errors before running behavior
tests. Run the relevant suite, collect every failure, and group failures by
module or likely shared cause.

### Step 2: Debug

Use the debugger agent. Analyze each failure group and prove shared root causes
before modifying code.

### Step 3: Plan

Use the planner agent. Prioritize shared root causes first and record
dependencies between fixes.

### Step 4: Implement

Implement fixes in dependency order and keep changes cause-aligned.

### Step 5: Retest

Use the tester agent. Start with the narrow failing test, then broaden across
the blast radius. If tests still fail, return to Step 2.

### Step 6: Review

Use the code-reviewer agent and retain fresh test evidence.

## Common Commands

```bash
npm test
bun test
pytest
go test ./...
```

## Tips

- Run one failing test first for faster iteration
- Compare assertions with intended behavior
- Verify fixtures and mocks represent real contracts
- Change a test only when evidence proves the test is wrong
