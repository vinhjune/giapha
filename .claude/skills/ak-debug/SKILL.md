# Debugging & System Investigation

Comprehensive framework combining systematic debugging, root cause tracing, defense-in-depth validation, verification protocols, and system-level investigation (logs, CI/CD, databases, performance).

## Core Principle

**NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST**

Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Find root cause, fix at source, validate at every layer, verify before claiming success.

## When to Use

**Code-level:** Test failures, bugs, unexpected behavior, build failures, integration problems
**System-level:** Server errors, CI/CD pipeline failures, performance degradation, database issues, log analysis
**Always:** Before claiming work complete

## Techniques

### 1. Systematic Debugging (`references/systematic-debugging.md`)

Four-phase framework: Root Cause Investigation → Pattern Analysis → Hypothesis Testing → Implementation. Complete each phase before proceeding. No fixes without Phase 1.

**Load when:** Any bug/issue requiring investigation and fix

### 2. Root Cause Tracing (`references/root-cause-tracing.md`)

Trace bugs backward through call stack to find original trigger. Fix at source, not symptom. Includes `scripts/find-polluter.sh` for bisecting test pollution.

**Load when:** Error deep in call stack, unclear where invalid data originated

### 3. Defense-in-Depth (`references/defense-in-depth.md`)

Validate at every layer: Entry validation → Business logic → Environment guards → Debug instrumentation

**Load when:** After finding root cause, need comprehensive validation

### 4. Verification (`references/verification.md`)

**Iron law:** NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE. Run command. Read output. Then claim result.

**Load when:** About to claim work complete, fixed, or passing

### 5. Investigation Methodology (`references/investigation-methodology.md`)

Five-step structured investigation for system-level issues: Initial Assessment → Data Collection → Analysis → Root Cause ID → Solution Development

**Load when:** Server incidents, system behavior analysis, multi-component failures

### 6. Log & CI/CD Analysis (`references/log-and-ci-analysis.md`)

Collect and analyze logs from servers, CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), application layers. Tools: `gh` CLI, structured log queries, correlation across sources.

**Load when:** CI/CD pipeline failures, server errors, deployment issues

### 7. Performance Diagnostics (`references/performance-diagnostics.md`)

Identify bottlenecks, analyze query performance, develop optimization strategies. Covers database queries, API response times, resource utilization.

**Load when:** Performance degradation, slow queries, high latency, resource exhaustion

### 8. Reporting Standards (`references/reporting-standards.md`)

Structured diagnostic reports: Executive Summary → Technical Analysis → Recommendations → Evidence

**Load when:** Need to produce investigation report or diagnostic summary

### 9. Investigation Tracking (`references/task-management-debugging.md`)

For multi-step investigations, discover the live task-management surface and
use it to track dependencies, ownership, and parallel evidence collection when
available. Otherwise, update the active plan. Plan files are the durable source of truth,
so debugging never depends on a particular client's task API.

**Load when:** Multi-component investigation (3+ steps), parallel log collection, coordinating debugger subagents

### 10. Frontend Verification (`references/frontend-verification.md`)

Visual verification of frontend implementations via `ak:agent-browser`, `ak:chrome-profile`, Chrome MCP / `chrome-devtools-mcp`, or project-native browser tests. Use `ak:chrome-profile` and its exact tab binding when real Chrome profile state matters; raw Chrome MCP navigation is only for generic/profile-independent inspection. Detect if frontend-related -> check browser tool availability -> screenshot + console error check -> report. Skip if not frontend.

**Load when:** Implementation touches frontend files (tsx/jsx/vue/svelte/html/css), UI bugs, visual regressions

## Quick Reference

```
Code bug       → systematic-debugging.md (Phase 1-4)
  Deep in stack  → root-cause-tracing.md (trace backward)
  Found cause    → defense-in-depth.md (add layers)
  Claiming done  → verification.md (verify first)

System issue   → investigation-methodology.md (5 steps)
  CI/CD failure  → log-and-ci-analysis.md
  Slow system    → performance-diagnostics.md
  Need report    → reporting-standards.md

Frontend fix   → frontend-verification.md (agent-browser/chrome-profile/Chrome MCP)
```

## Tools Integration

- **Database:** `psql` for PostgreSQL queries and diagnostics
- **CI/CD:** `gh` CLI for GitHub Actions logs and pipeline debugging
- **Codebase:** `ak:docs-seeker` skill for package/plugin docs; `ak:repomix` skill for codebase summary
- **Scouting:** `/ak:scout` or `/ak:scout ext` for finding relevant files
- **Frontend:** `ak:agent-browser`, `ak:chrome-profile`, Chrome MCP / `chrome-devtools-mcp`, or project-native browser tests for visual verification. For real profile state, let `chrome-profile open --json` create the tab and bind to its returned selector before using MCP inspection tools.
- **Skills:** Activate `ak:problem-solving` skill when stuck on complex issues

## Red Flags

Stop and follow process if thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "Should work now" / "Seems fixed"
- "Tests pass, we're done"

**All mean:** Return to systematic process.

## Workflow Position

**Typically follows:** `/ak:scout` (after locating relevant code)
**Typically precedes:** `/ak:fix` (fix the diagnosed issue), `/ak:brainstorm` (explore solutions for complex problems)
**Related:** `/ak:scout` (discover before debugging), `/ak:fix` (fix after diagnosing)
