# AgentKit Domain Routing

Use this file only when choosing between installed AgentKit skills. If the user
asks to discover or install external skills, return to `../SKILL.md` and use the
Skills CLI flow.

## Routing Rules

- If the user names a skill, use that skill.
- Pick one primary skill per distinct intent. Mention secondary skills only as
  follow-up helpers.
- If the task needs a multi-step sequence, read
  `../../cook/references/workflow-routing.md` after choosing the primary skill.
- If two skills overlap, prefer the more specific domain skill over a generic
  workflow skill.
