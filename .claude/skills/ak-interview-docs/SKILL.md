# Interview Docs

Turn the user's own knowledge, taste, and decisions into maintained documents.
This skill does not invent content, prioritize an unordered user list, or derive
documentation from source code.

## Select a Mode

- Use vision mode for project vision, README direction, and ADR decisions.
- Use structured-doc mode for one user-authored document such as principles,
  strategy, reviews, or a framework.
- If the request fits both modes, ask one concise question before writing.

## Vision Mode

1. Read README.md and the existing docs/adr directory before asking anything.
2. Ask a batch of five high-variety questions unless the user requests another
   number or a focused area.
3. After every answer, re-read the affected document and patch the user’s words
   into README.md or an ADR before processing the next answer.
4. Keep README.md to vision. Put decisions in short numbered ADR files with
   Status, Context, Decision, and Consequences.
5. Continue until the user ends the interview. Keep replies concise and in
   plain English.

## Structured-Doc Mode

1. Read nearby documents and create a minimal skeleton once.
2. Ask exactly one specific, open question.
3. Wait for the answer, re-read the target section, and patch the document
   before asking the next question.
4. Treat a user-provided list as an unordered set. Ask explicitly before
   assigning rank, sequence, or priority.
5. Preserve user wording and edits. Never overwrite an existing document or
   add speculative sections.

## Boundaries and Safety

- Use ak-brainstorm when the AI should propose options; use ak-docs when
  documentation should be derived from code.
- Do not write secrets, personal data, or credentials into docs.
- Never use an ADR to make an unapproved architectural decision. Record only a
  decision the user has explicitly made.
