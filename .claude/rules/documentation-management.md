# Project Documentation Management

Use this file when creating plans or changing project documentation.

## When To Update Docs

Update docs only when the change affects user-visible behavior, setup, commands, architecture, security posture, public contracts, or future maintainer decisions. Do not add changelog noise for purely internal edits unless the repo already requires it.

Common docs:

- `docs/code-standards.md`
- `docs/system-architecture.md`
- `docs/project-roadmap.md` or `docs/development-roadmap.md`
- `docs/project-changelog.md` when present

## Plan Location

Save plans under `plans/<timestamp>-<descriptive-slug>/`.

Use:

```text
plans/<slug>/
  plan.md
  phase-01-<name>.md
  reports/
```

Keep `plan.md` short: status, phases, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and links to phase files.

Phase files should include only the detail needed to execute safely:

- context links
- requirements
- files to modify/create/delete
- implementation steps
- tests or validation
- risks and rollback notes

Before updating docs, read the existing document. After updating, verify dates, links, and claims match the actual change.
